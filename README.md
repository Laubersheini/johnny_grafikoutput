# johnny grafikoutput
Simulation of a von neumann arcitecture

This is an experimental version of the johnny simulator supporting graphics and keystrokes

The last 2500 adresses are a simple framebuffer for the display with higer values coresponding to brighter pixels. Addresses 7495-7499 are set to a one if the spacebar, or the arrow keys are pressed. This allows for very simple games to be written for Johnny.

The programm is hosted at:
